## Project Description
Typwind is a specialized teaching methodology developed by Windekind, a special education school in Leuven, Belgium, designed for teenagers with neuromotor impairments. It helps them learn to type as writing can be challenging for them. Typwind is currently only available as a paper manual. For online exercises, Windekind look towards a game called RapidTyping. While RapidTyping provides online exercises, they don't follow the Typwind methodology. To address this gap, we've created a new platform that incorporates Typwind's principles.

Our platform made with the user experience kept in mind throughout the whole design process. Children cannot only make exercises but also collect avatars. This is an example of gamification, which we've attributed great importance to to motivate the students. The teachers can also keep better track of their students, to follow up on them and customise exercises for them. Everything is available on this platform that keeps simplicity and fun for its users in mind.
